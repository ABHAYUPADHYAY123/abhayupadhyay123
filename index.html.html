<b> What is Radiation?</b>
<br> <br>
<i> Radiation is the process of transfer of heat energy from one medium to the other without heating the space in between them.it occurs in the absence of any medium.for example, the heat given off from the sun cannot reach us by the process conduction and convection.this is because both the processes require a medium , these processes cannot transfer the heat to the earth.in such conditions,heat transfer occurs through radiation.The energy transferred in this process is termed as radiant energy. </i>
